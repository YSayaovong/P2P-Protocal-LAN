# Peer-to-Peer Protocols and Local Area Networks Project Paper

## Overview
This project paper explores key aspects of communication protocols used in peer-to-peer networks and Local Area Networks (LANs). It includes discussions on message fragmentation, Stop-and-Wait ARQ systems, delay-bandwidth product calculations, sequence number wrap-around times, and a comparison of MAC protocols (ALOHA vs. CSMA-CD) in LANs.
